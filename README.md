# particle-system

Particle system challenge with two types of simulations: Snow falling and leaves tumbling.

## Getting Started

For this challenge I decided to go with making a particle system API made in a Node.js/Angular 1 stack. I made each simulation an angular ([directive](https://github.com/bolivartorres/particle-system/tree/master/directives)) on its own and each one uses motion effects functions that I wrote that simulate the movement described in the name of the function (see [motionEffects.js](https://github.com/bolivartorres/particle-system/blob/master/utils/motionEffects.js)).

### Prerequisites

You need ([npm](https://nodejs.org/)) installed in your machine to run this app.

Once you have npm in your machine, pull the code, navigate to the code's directory, then run:

`npm install`

After that, simply run:

`npm-start`

Your browser should open up a window automatically and show you the app running.

### Installing
